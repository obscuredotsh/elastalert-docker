TheHive4py
==========

TheHive4py is a Python API client for
`TheHive <https://thehive-project.org/>`__, a scalable 3-in-1 open
source and free security incident response platform designed to make
life easier for SOCs, CSIRTs, CERTs and any information security
practitioner dealing with security incidents that need to be
investigated and acted upon swiftly.

TheHive4py allows analysts to send alerts to TheHive out of different
sources. Those alerts can then be previewed and imported into cases
using pre-defined templates.

For example, a SOC may ask its constituency to send suspicious email
reports to a specific mailbox that a script polls at regular intervals.
When a new email is received, the script parses it then calls TheHive4py
to create a corresponding alert in TheHive. Once the alert is raised,
SOC analysts will get a notification thanks to TheHive's live stream so
they can preview it and import it if deemed worth investigating using a
specific template.

Caution - WIP
=============

TheHive4py is considered work in progress. It is considered *beta*
software though we are using it on a regular basis for the use case
outlined above. It should be sufficient in most situations where you
need to interact with `TheHive's REST
API <https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHiveDocs/blob/master/api/README.md>`__.
If not, please feel free to contribute and submit pull requests or
`request missing
features <https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive4py/issues/new>`__
if you are not comfortable with Python.

Use It
======

On macOS and Linux, type:
